Videos and images captured by witnesses show just how much water was unleashed when Michigan's Edenville Dam failed.

Officials had been warning nearby residents to evacuate all day Tuesday because of fears the hydroelectric dam holding back Wixom Lake would break.
It was announced on Facebook around 6 p.m. Tuesday that the dam had failed -- and a torrent of water was rushing down the Tittabawassee River. The water's unrelenting flow continued overnight and daylight on Wednesday showed how little was left of the lake.
